# GuessmypAIting
IA that guess the artist or the genre of a painting

1\The GuessMyPainting.py is an python script using streamlit library that creates an html website. By executing it, it opens a browser and propose you to upload an painting, choose a model and the prediction you want to make (artist or genre)

 - Carreful, because of lack of time, I only trained the different models on 10 artists and 2 genres. 

List of the artists availables for guessing: ['Vincent_van_Gogh' 'Edgar_Degas' 'Pablo_Picasso' 'Pierre-Auguste_Renoir'
 'Albrecht_DÃ¼rer' 'Paul_Gauguin' 'Francisco_Goya' 'Rembrandt'
 'Alfred_Sisley' 'Titian' 'Marc_Chagall']

 - The accuracy, parameters, explanation of every model is in the powerpoint of my presentation.
 - Only the CNN model has been uploaded for the Genres. You can only guess the genres with this model
- You can see the notebook for one model in the folder (Notebook_Model.ipynb)
